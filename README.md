## Student Management System (Java + Oracle JDBC)

## Overview
This is a console-based Student Management System developed using Java.
The application performs CRUD operations by integrating with an Oracle
Database using JDBC.

## Features
- Add student records
- View all students
- Search student by roll number
- Update student details
- Delete student records

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JDBC
- Oracle Database
- SQL

## Project Structure
- Student.java – Model class representing student data
- DBConnection.java – Handles Oracle JDBC connection
- StudentService.java – Contains business logic and database operations
- Main.java – Menu-driven entry point

## Learning Outcomes
- Understood JDBC architecture and driver-based connectivity
- Worked with Oracle JDBC drivers and classpath configuration
- Implemented database operations using PreparedStatement
- Gained practical experience debugging real JDBC errors

## How to Run
1. Ensure Oracle Database is running.
2. Add the Oracle JDBC driver (ojdbc8.jar) to the classpath.
3. Compile and run the program from the terminal.
